This is the official repository for the paper titled "Nuclei instance segmentation from histopathology images using Bayesian dropout based deep learning".

We are currently under the process of filtering the code snipets to reproduce our results. Feel free to contact us or rise a github issue. we share the codes, please remember the codes might be raw format, and have to comment much of the code or replace.
